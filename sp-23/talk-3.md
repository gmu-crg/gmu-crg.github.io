### **Abstract**

In this two-part lecture, we will attempt to address two fundamental questions â€” 
what are lattices, and what makes them cryptographically interesting? For the 
first part, we review the mathematical background, introduce the shortest vector 
problem and consider the LLL algorithm, all with an eye towards modern 
foundations of lattice-based cryptography.
