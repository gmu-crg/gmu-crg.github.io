### **Abstract**

This talk serves as an introduction to cryptography based on isogenies of 
elliptic curves. An overview of elliptic curves, as well as their isogenies is 
given. Following this, a presentation on the (now broken) NIST-PQC submission 
SIKE is reviewed. We conclude with a discussion on the key-recovery attack by 
Castryck and Decru.
