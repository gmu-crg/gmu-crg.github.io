### **Abstract**

In this two-part lecture, we will attempt to address two fundamental questions â€” 
what are lattices, and what makes them cryptographically interesting? For the 
second part we will focus on the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem, and look 
at the worst-case to average-case reduction for SIS.
